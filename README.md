# Start changes on week one
This has been quite a challenging piece for me. Because I have not yet touched into these things in programming. Although I have been having to adjust and learn quite a lot, it has been rewarding with every little step I take into a fully functional React App. Cannot wait!

# Start changes on week two
It has been hard to understand really if I am getting anywhere or not. Just when I think things are looking good, BOOM! Wake into reality and something else is messed up. Still learning a lot!

# Start changes on week three
There is so much I have learned and yet it seems the simple things I am having the most difficulty. My styling all around has got me frustrated beyond the point where I had to walk away. I surely hope to make some improvements this week going into my last week. 

# Week four - final work
I have so much more to do on my app. But I am going to keep on doing my assignments and making this app look professional as I can make it. I really do believe that it is looking very good and the colors are nice. I have also implemented a light and dark theme. Hoping that turns out nice.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you could not customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
